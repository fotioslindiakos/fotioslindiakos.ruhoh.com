Well after saying I was going to start a blog a few months ago, I decided to give it another go.
But when I went back to the old one (based on the awesome [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)), I found out that the developer started a new project called [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com).
Being one who believes in trying new tech for the sake of trying it, I decided to give it a try, and it's pretty neat.
I also wholeheartedly believe in the idea that Jade is trying to push with defining a [Universal Blog API](http://ruhoh.com/universal-blog-api/).

Similar to JB and earlier projects (like [PyBlosxom](http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/)), it uses a directory structure and simple markdown files for posts, then all of the magic is handled by templates.
The thing I love about it, is how clean it is and the fact that it works great out of the box.
I've become a big fan of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) recently, so this is so easy.

Also, since I've recently finished grad school, I've found myself having more free time and even more crazy project ideas.
I'd like this to become a dumping ground for all of those ideas. 

My goal is every time I have an idea, I am going to create a GitHub repository and just start braindumping into a README file there.
I'll also hopefully start a post here with my basic first ideas.
This way if I have something that starts to catch on, I might eventually have an audience that could help run with it.
We'll see how it goes...
